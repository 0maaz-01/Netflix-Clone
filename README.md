# Netflix Clone (MERN Stack Full-Stack App)

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that replicates the core functionalities of Netflix. It features **user authentication**, **movie browsing**, **video streaming UI**, **search feature** and a **search history system**.

This project demonstrates a seamless integration of frontend and backend technologies to build a robust streaming service-like experience, with full responsiveness and secure user flows.

## Features & Highlights : 

1) **Movies & Series Sections 🎬📺:** The homepage is divided into two separate sections—one for Movies and another for Series, making it easy to browse by category.
   
2) **Search Functionality 🔎:** A powerful search bar allows users to search for movies, series, or actors by name.
   
3) **Search History 🕵️:** The app tracks and stores a search history, so users can easily revisit previously watched or searched content.
 
4) **Detailed Movie Page 📝🎞:** Clicking on a title shows in-depth info, the trailer, and a carousel of similar recommendations based on that content.

5) **User Authentication 🔐:** Secure registration and login system with JWT-based authentication.

6) **Responsive Design 📱💻:** This website is highly responsive and works well on all screen sizes. 

7) **Streaming UI 🍿:** Designed to replicate the Netflix user experience with hover effects, trailer previews, and category sliders.

8) **MongoDB Integration 🍃:** All user data and preferences are stored persistently using MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose.

9) **Protected Routes 🛡:** Authenticated routes ensure that only logged-in users can access personal content like the dashboard or watchlist.
